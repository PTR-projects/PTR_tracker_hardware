# PTR-Tracker hardware repository
Here you'll find the design files for the Tracker PCB

Looking for software? That's [here](https://github.com/karmelek96/ptr-tracker-firmware)

# How to order
The folders contain the kicad projects and JLC assembly files for the 2 frequency variants of the device.

You can order the PCBs and solder them yourself, or use JLC's assembly service. Pick the frequency variant, and open the `PRODUCTION` folder. There you'll find the gerbers, BOM, and footprint positions. The only parameter you need to tick is to specify the order number location, we hid it under the GPS antenna. Don't forget to pick a color!

# Required parts
Only 1 side of the board will be soldered by JLC. You need to install an SMD dip switch, 2 0603 LEDs, a GPS antenna and an SMA connector.
